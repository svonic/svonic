	It's important to note that the parent should have relative positioning because the ripple effect is absolutely positioned and will cover the closest parent with relative positioning. The parent element should also be given the ion-activatable class, which tells the ripple effect that the element is clickable.

	The default type, "bounded", will expand the ripple effect from the click position outwards. To add a ripple effect that always starts in the center of the element and expands in a circle, add an "unbounded" type. It's recommended to add overflow: hidden to the parent element to avoid the ripple overflowing its container, especially with an unbounded ripple.
